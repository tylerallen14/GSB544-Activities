        "\n",
        "#### Check results often\n",
        "\n",
        "If a chunk of code runs smoothly without giving you any error or warnings this does not necessarily mean it accomplished the desired task.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is a good habit to check the results of your code every time you finish a task.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you created or updated a data frame, make sure your edits did what you hoped.  Use the *Environment* or the `head()` function to investigate your changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Document your work\n",
        "\n",
        "In the text before the code chunk, make sure to briefly state what the point of the chunk is.  This will remind later readers - which might be your future self! - what the desired output is.\n",

        "Use comments in the code to give quick explanations of the goals of complex steps.\n",

        "\n",
        "It can be hard to spot bugs in code that you yourself wrote.t\n",
        "(Have you ever sent a text message and not spotted an obvious  typo?  Same idea!)\n",
        "\n",
        "Work with people around you if you can - if something goes wrong, ask a friend to take a peek at your code and see if any glaring errors (like *syntax error*) pop out.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Explain your code out loud\n",
        "\n",
        "The best way to troubleshoot a sneaky bug is to explain out loud each step of your code, and what you hoped to accomplish.\n",
